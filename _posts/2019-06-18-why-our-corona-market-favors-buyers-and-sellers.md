There are several things happening in our market right now that benefit both buyers and sellers.&nbsp;

First of all, **interest rates have dropped, which is great news if you’re a buyer because it means you qualify to buy more.** If you’re a seller, this means you have a better chance of getting the price you want.&nbsp;

Also, the average days on market for homes is just 30 days. Competition is hot among buyers, which means sellers will be able to get a lot of offers and counter however they see fit.&nbsp;

On the other hand, buyers have a greater ability to negotiate closing costs, which is something they wouldn’t have been able to do beforehand. They also have a greater opportunity to negotiate other items in the contract, such as the termite clearance.&nbsp;

If you’re a seller and you want to take advantage of these conditions, the key is to **make your home look amazing before you put it on the market.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions about our market or you’d like to know what you can do as a buyer to get the best deal possible, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
