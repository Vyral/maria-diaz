As a buyer, the final walk-through of your soon-to-be home is an important part of the home buying process, and there are a few tips you need to remember to make the most of it.&nbsp;

Before the final walk-through, though, **it’s very important that you order a home inspection.** You can walk through a home and fall in love with it, but if you’re not a professional home inspector, what you don’t see might cost you a lot of money down the road.&nbsp;

Now, **here are my four tips that will help you get the most out of your final walk-through:**

1\. Do it a week before closing—not the day of. If you wait until the day of closing, you won’t have time to check that everything has been completed and there aren’t any further issues.

2\. Use your phone to plug into the outlets to see if they work properly.&nbsp;

3\. Make sure there are no leftover items still in the house (TVs, furniture, etc.). If there are, tell the seller that they need to be removed.&nbsp;

4\. Be emotionally prepared for a surprise. When homes are on the market, they’re usually staged and turnkey. Once they’re under contract and the seller has moved everything out before closing, though, they don’t look the same, so be prepared for that.&nbsp;
