Here are the five things you should avoid during a home sale:

**1. Bad color schemes.** Be cautious with the color scheme you go with inside your home. Your tastes might not align with the buyer’s, effectively hurting your chances of making your home stand out to that buyer.&nbsp;

**2. Too much personal taste.** The key here is to think like a buyer. When it comes time to sell, don’t overdo the personal touch to your home. Buyers may not find your arrangements appealing.&nbsp;

**3. Bad odors.**&nbsp;In my experience, the top two odors that are a turnoff to buyers are from pets and cigarette smoke. The presence of these types of odors is often difficult to remove from the home, so hiring a professional carpet cleaner is the way to go before putting your home on the market. &nbsp; &nbsp;

**4. Inflexibility with showings.** It’s imperative that you demonstrate flexibility with scheduling when showing your home. Failing to do so often leads to missed opportunities. Imagine this: You have a motivated buyer who’s prepared to make an offer on a home, and they’d like to see yours. Instead, you fail to cater to what’s convenient for them, and as a result, lose your opportunity. To make matters worse, your home may end up sitting on the market for a long time, which causes buyers to wonder if something is wrong with it. What I found works best is providing full access to buyers so that they can freely walk through your property and having the aid of a satellite lock box for real estate agents to have the ability to show your home even when you're not there so you can obtain the offer you want in the time you want. &nbsp;

**5. Disguising problem areas.** Coming up with a quick, superficial fix to a larger problem area in the home may seem like a good idea, but buyers will likely notice. Try to tackle these repairs in a meaningful way before your home is on the market. &nbsp;&nbsp;
