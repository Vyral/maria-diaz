I want to take a moment to wish you a happy holiday and thank you for all the referrals you’ve sent me this past year. Enjoy your time with your friends and family as we close out 2018 and look toward 2019. I hope we can continue our business relationship in the new year. Remember, if there’s anything I can ever help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. To hear my full holiday message, watch this short video.
