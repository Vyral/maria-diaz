When buying a home, you’ll go through a series of emotions that might unsettle you, but they’re perfectly normal. Here’s what to expect:

**1. Online photos can be deceiving.** Great online photos look, well, great, but it’s better to show up at the house in person. When you’re actually there, you’ll notice details that weren’t visible in the photos (or were edited out), like marks on the walls, tears in the carpets, and so on. You’ll also get to see rooms from angles not shown in the photos. Sometimes this disparity can disappoint people (even to the point of moving to a different listing), but it’s a part of the process that you should be prepared for.

2**. Buying a home can feel like a never-ending slog.** As homebuyers, you will need to be patient—it’s worth it. I know that with some buyers, there’s competition in the market for many homes, but if you’re ready and willing, you’ll make a strong offer and end up inside the house that you want for yourself and your family.

**3. You might not get everything you want.** This is why we emphasize that, if a home meets all or most of your criteria, you need to be ready and able to make the strongest offer you can. That way, you don’t have to worry about the competition, since you can be sure of getting the property.

If you’re feeling anxious about the buying process or if you have any questions, you’re strongly encouraged to reach out to me. I can guide you during the process and hopefully give you some peace of mind.
