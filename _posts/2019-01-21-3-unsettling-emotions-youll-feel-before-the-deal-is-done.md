When buying a home, you’ll go through a series of emotions that might unsettle you, but they’re perfectly normal. Here’s what to expect:

**1. Online photos can be deceiving.** Great online photos look, well, great, but it’s better to show up at the house in person. When you’re actually there, you’ll notice details that weren’t visible in the photos (or were edited out), like marks on the walls, tears in the carpets, and so on. You’ll also get to see rooms from angles not shown in the photos. Sometimes this disparity can disappoint people (even to the point of moving to a different listing), but it’s a part of the process that you should be prepared for.

**2. Buying a home can feel like a never-ending slog.** As a homebuyer, you will need to be patient. You will experience a range of emotions in the pursuit of finding your perfect home, but it will be worthwhile when you finally settle in. I know there could be competition in the buying process amongst other homebuyers so you must be willing and ready to make a strong offer in order to get the house of your dreams and get your offer accepted.<br><br>**3. You might not get everything you want.** This is why I emphasize that, if a home meets all or most of your criteria, you need to be ready and able to make the strongest offer so that you don’t have to worry about any competition with other homebuyers and undoubtedly get the home you want.&nbsp;<br><br>If you’re feeling anxious about the buying process or if you have any questions, you must reach out to me. Don't let fear stop you. Take my guidance and allow me to guide the way. You'll avoid making the wrong choice or missing out on a great deal.
