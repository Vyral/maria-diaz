Today I’m so very excited to cast the spotlight on and introduce you to **Dose Cafe**—one of the hottest spots in all of Orange County\! Joining me to discuss this lovely cafe at length is the owner, Rima Masri.&nbsp;

According to Rima, the decision to open her cafe in Anaheim Plaza was an easy one to make. Not only is this location a beautiful one, but she was also struck by its high level of activity and cleanliness.

**The idea for open Dose Cafe was hatched out of Rima’s longtime love of coffee and baking.** As a self-described coffee connoisseur, she couldn’t wait to open a cafe where both she could serve both. The rest is history as Dose Cafe has been open now for a little less than four years now. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Crack open one of Dose Cafe’s menus, and you’ll find seven different sandwiches, 8 different salads, and everything from cheesecakes to macaroons to pastries in the dessert column. Now that the weather is heating up, you can enjoy their range of refreshments that include cucumber lemonade, smoothies, flavored lattes, shaved ice, and so much more.&nbsp;

For those who’ve never stopped in and are curious what food selection they should try, Rima recommends either the grilled chicken panini served on Italian Ciabatta bread or the turkey, bacon, and cheese, which is served on freshly baked croissant bread.&nbsp;

Then, finish off your meal with an Oreo Cream for dessert, which is best described as a mocha freeze with Oreo cookies mixed in. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Dose Cafe’s overseas-sourced coffee beans are Arabic and are of immaculate 85-grade quality—with just one sip, you’ll recognize its premium quality instantly.&nbsp;

When asked about her favorite items, she cites a few of the dessert options—among them, she sings the praises of the red velvet cupcakes, the strawberry cheesecake, and last but not least, the white mocha freeze.&nbsp;

College students, couples, families, and so many other types of patrons frequent Dose Cafe, and **if you’re in the area, this spot simply must be on your list of places to go.**
