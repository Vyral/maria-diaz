Knowing fact from fiction in real estate is critical to a successful home sale. Here are six common, but potentially harmful, myths about home selling that you need to stop believing at once if you want your success to be assured:

**1. You can sell your home by yourself.** You really do need to hire a real estate professional; we know the market, the area, how to attract buyers to your property, what your house is worth, and we can help you sell it for the most money possible.

**2. You know better than experts about the value of your home.** A lot of the time, I find myself speaking to sellers who are attached to the property they’ve invested their money and time into. Because of this, they sometimes overprice the home. You need to price a home correctly in order to sell; a home that stagnates on the market usually sells for less.

**3. It’s fine to sell your home as-is.** That’s just incorrect: If you want to net top dollar for your home and sell it quickly, you have to care about your property and how it looks. You’ll need to remove all clutter, deep clean it, and make certain updates. After all, if it’s going to put more money in &nbsp;your pocket, why not do it?

**4. Upgrades should be drastic.** This is absolutely false. Be careful about which upgrades you invest in, as not every person who comes to see your home will be interested in everything they see. They might remove some of the upgrades you’ve added, or erase your modifications with their own, which effectively tosses the money you spent on those upgrades out the window.

**5. Spring is the best time to sell.** The best time to sell your home is when you need to sell it. For example, though many sellers choose to wait until spring to list, doing so in the winter could be advantageous since you’ll have fewer sellers to compete with, and the buyers out and about during the winter tend to be more serious about purchasing homes.

**6. You can rely entirely on online estimates.** I find that certain familiar real estate websites often overprice properties. This, again, is why it’s so important to hire a real estate professional to assist with your home sale.
