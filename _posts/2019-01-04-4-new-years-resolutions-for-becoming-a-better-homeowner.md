Here are four New Year’s resolutions that will make you a better homeowner in 2019: 

    **1. Get out of debt.** If you create a yearly budget for home improvements and home maintenance, it will discourage you from overspending and help you save money for major items, such as installing a new roof or replacing an appliance. 

    **2. Get organized.** No excuses—the clutter has to go. Start creating more storage space so you can stash your belongings easier. There are a couple ways you can do this. First, you can install a high shelf between the walls of a narrow hallway. You can also store items in out-of-the-way areas, such as underneath a staircase or between wall studs.

     **3. Drink less.** Houses are thirsty—the average household uses about 400 gallons of water each day, or over $700 per year in sewage and water costs. Making a few simple adjustments, such as installing a few EPA-certified WaterSense products around your home, can save you as much as $200 from your annual water bill. This will also reduce the amount of heat needed to heat your water, so when you factor how much you’d cut in terms of energy costs, you can save as much as $300 total per year.

     **4. Get fit.** If you’re looking to get in shape, keeping up with routine home maintenance can help you—you’ll burn calories while keeping your house in tiptop shape as well. Try these essential fixups from CalorieLab:
