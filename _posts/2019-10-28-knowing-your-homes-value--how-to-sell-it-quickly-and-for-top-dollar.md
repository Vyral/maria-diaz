How can you determine the value of your home? Once you know its value, how can you sell it quickly and for top dollar?&nbsp;

First, **to determine the value of your home, you must consider the comparable homes in the area**—just because a home is in the same community doesn’t mean it looks the same, has the same upgrades, or is in the same condition.

To improve your home’s value before listing it, you may need to make your own upgrades, such as repainting. If you do this, make sure you choose a neutral color. You don’t want to spend a lot of money painting a color that appeals to your eyes but not to a buyer’s. Tips like this illustrate why it’s important to listen to your professional agent. It’s their job to help you sell quickly and net top dollar doing so.

Next, **price your home competitively.** Us agents prefer to list homes at their market value, but we can also have your home sell above asking price, so again, listen to what your agent tells you.&nbsp;

To create traction and bring in buyers, **you also need to show your home well.** How you show it depends on what type of home you have and what kind of community you live in. You may be able to show it as is; you may need to make some minor cosmetic touch ups (as I mentioned above).&nbsp;

In any case, don’t go overboard and spend money you don’t need to. A lot of buyers make the mistake of upgrading their home according to their own tastes instead of what buyers might like. To prevent this from happening, look at the other listed homes in the area and see what they offer. How you show your house will determine the quality of the buyers you attract. You want qualified buyers who won’t waste your time or disrupt your moving schedule.
