**If you’re thinking of buying a home this spring, here is a list of pros and cons to help you make your decision:**

**1\. You’ll love the inventory.** I know you’re seeing a lot of homes coming on the market right now that are turnkey and ready to move into. This is great news if you're thinking of buying.

**2\. You’ll hate the competition.** There will be tons of other people looking at the same properties that you are. Don’t get your heart broken, and make sure you are ready and willing to submit a strong offer as soon as you come across your dream home.

**3\. You’ll love the open houses.** The weather is nice, so there will be tons of open houses out there. Check them out on the weekends and take notes about what you like and don’t like in a home.

**4\. You will hate the time-related pressure.** A lot of spring buyers have a deadline that they need to meet. You don’t want to take the chance and miss any opportunities to buy a home in this market.

**5\. You’ll love the warmer weather.** It’s enjoyable to get out and go look at homes with this weather, especially since there are so many on the market.

**6\. You’ll hate the higher prices.** Because of the competition in the market, that will bump up prices. This is another reminder to submit a strong offer every time.

If you have any questions for me about buying a home or about anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
