There are a few reasons why hiring the same agent to help you buy and sell a home is far superior to hiring two different agents. &nbsp;

For one thing, **you’ve already built up a relationship and trust with them.** Along with that, they’ll know and understand your needs. Whether you buy first or sell first, the agent will be better prepared and informed to serve your needs in the second half of the process.

They’ll also have pre-established knowledge of your profile and the time frames you want to work within—what you qualify for, when you need to move, when you need to sell, etc. This particular agent will have an intimate awareness of your plans and goals that a new agent simply won’t have.&nbsp;

I strive to always go the extra mile for my clients no matter what their needs are, and I especially appreciate it when my clients place their trust in me to help them with both sides of the transaction. **Help with closing costs, home warranties, and negotiations for repairs are just a few of the services my clients can expect from me. &nbsp; &nbsp;**

If you have any further questions or there’s a topic you’d like to hear me cover in a future video, please give me a call at 951-591-0413 or email me at MariaDiaz@RealEstateServices.com. I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
